# Map_task

This project is a responsive mapping application called "PinPoint Mapper". It allows users to save and manage location pins with remarks and addresses.

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for both large and small devices.
- Sidebar to view saved pins.
- Interactive map to add, select, and delete pins.
- Data persistence using backend API and localStorage.

## Responsiveness Update

The recent update improves responsiveness for small devices without changing the layout for large devices. The layout stacks vertically on small screens, and the sidebar and map adjust their widths accordingly.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

You can deploy this project to any platform that supports Next.js applications.
